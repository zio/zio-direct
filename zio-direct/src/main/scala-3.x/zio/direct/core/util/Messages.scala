Detected the use of a mutable collection inside a defer clause.
Mutable collections can cause many potential issues as a result of defer-clause
rewrites so they are not allowed (Unless it is inside of a run-call).

Invocations of `run(...)` (or `op.run`) were detected even after all the transformations of zio-direct were completed.
That means that zio-direct cannot successfully process the input you have passed into it. Try to use defer.verbose

val DeclarationNotAllowed =

Using Assignment inside of run(...:ZIO) sections is permitted but not recommended,
(outside of an `await` call they are forbidden entirely). Consider using ZIO Refs.
=========
Instead of doing somethiing like this:

      println(s"Currently: $i")

An await cannot be inside an await. In order to do this,
write the content of the outer await into a variable first.

For example:

Change it to:
  val a = run(ZIO.succeed  { if (foo) ZIO.succeed(x) else ZIO.succeed(y) })

Assignment is generally not allowed inside of defer calls. Please use a ZIO Ref instead.

val MoveAwaitOut =

Move the `await` call outside of this structure in order to use it.
=========
For example, change this:

To this:
  defer {
    val result = run(httpGet(someUrl))

In some cases you should move the object out of the defer block entirely.
For example, change this:
  defer {
    def getUrl(url: String) = run(httpGet(url))
    service.lookup(getUrl(someStr))
  }
To this:
  def getUrl(url: String) = httpGet(url)
